# Swimlane UI Application

This project is a React-based swimlane user interface (UI) that facilitates the drag-and-drop functionality of blocks across different lanes representing various stages or states. The application allows users to manage block transitions, provide necessary data for transitions, and preview block details, including a history of all previous transitions.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Users can move blocks between different lanes representing various states (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Data Entry for Transitions**: Upon moving a block to a new state, users are prompted to provide a reason for the transition.
- **Block Preview**: Users can click on a block to view its details, including its current state and a history of all previous transitions.
- **Filtering**: A top-level filter mechanism allows users to filter blocks based on their titles.
